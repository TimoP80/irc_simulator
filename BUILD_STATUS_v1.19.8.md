## üéØ Application Status

### ‚úÖ Successful Startup Indicators:
From the debug log:
```
[INFO] Electron app ready
[INFO] Main window created successfully
[INFO] Production HTML file loaded successfully
[INFO] DOM ready
[INFO] Page finished loading
[INFO] Window ready to show
```

### üîß Known Issues (Non-Critical):

1. **Port Conflict Warning**: 
   - When previous instances are running, port 8080 may be in use
   - The app should try alternate ports (8081, 8082, 8083)
   - **Status**: Expected behavior, application continues to work

2. **Preload File Path**:
   - Warning: "Preload file not found: preload.js"
   - Falls back to: "preload.cjs"
   - **Status**: Working correctly, just cosmetic warning

3. **Window Fallback Timer**:
   - "Window not shown after timeout, forcing show"
   - This is the fallback mechanism we added working as intended
   - **Status**: Feature working correctly

## üì¶ Built Files Location:
- **Executable**: `release\win-unpacked\Station V - Virtual IRC Simulator.exe`
- **Size**: ~138 MB
- **Build Date**: 2025-10-27

## üöÄ Testing Recommendations:

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - ‚úÖ App starts without blank screen
   - ‚úÖ Window appears and stays visible
   - ‚úÖ Server starts (or uses existing instance)

2. **Send Message Test** (Critical Fix):
   - Create or join a public channel

   - Send a message
   - Verify: **No error "s.lastInteraction.getTime is not a function"**
   - AI users should respond normally

3. **Network Mode Test**:
   - Switch to Network mode
   - Connect to localhost:8080
   - Verify connection works
   - Test messaging
