Station V â€” Virtual IRC Simulator
---------------------------------

A resurrection project for my old irc simulator. Now with a fancy text based web interface, it feels both retro and modern at the same time.
But the underlying tech is from another world: It's full blown AI powered, using the Google Gemini API for creating all communication in the
virtual IRC world.

I have been thinking about connecting it to real IRC but not yet sure how to do it. The other way around might be possible. Like let other users
connect to your irc simulation session. That way you can have multiple real users chatting with the AI users.
