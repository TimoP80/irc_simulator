## üêõ Bug Fixes

### UI Disappearing While Typing

**Issue**: The chat UI would disappear while typing a message, making it difficult to compose messages.

**Root Cause**: Conflicting CSS classes in the conditional rendering logic (`flex`, `block`, and `hidden` being applied simultaneously).

**Fix**: Simplified the conditional logic in `App.tsx` line 5349 to prevent class conflicts.

**Impact**: Chat interface now remains stable while typing messages.

## üìÅ Archive Structure

### ARCHIVE/ Directory

The `ARCHIVE/` directory has been created for:
- Old documentation files that are no longer actively maintained
- Reference files from previous iterations
- Historical documentation

**Note**: Currently, the archive is mostly empty as the main documentation is still active and relevant. The archive structure is ready for future use when files need to be deprecated.
