# Windows Build Blank Screen Fix - v1.19.8

## üêõ Problem
The Windows Electron build was experiencing blank screen issues where the GUI would go blank within a few seconds after starting the application.

## ‚úÖ Solution
Fixed multiple issues that were causing the blank screen:

### 1. **External Google Fonts Import Blocked** (Critical)
- **Problem**: The HTML template was trying to load Google Fonts from an external CDN, which was blocked by Electron's security settings
- **Fix**: Removed the external Google Fonts import from `index-electron.html` and rely on system fallback fonts
- **Impact**: High - This was likely the primary cause of the blank screen

### 2. **Web Preferences Configuration** (High)
- **Problem**: Electron web preferences were too restrictive for local file loading
- **Fix**: 
  - Disabled `webSecurity` for local file loading
  - Set `sandbox: false`
  - Added `backgroundColor: '#111827'` to prevent white flash
  - Added `experimentalFeatures: true`
- **Impact**: High - Allows local files to load properly

### 3. **Vite Build Chunking** (Medium)
- **Problem**: Overly aggressive manual chunking was causing module loading issues in Electron
- **Fix**: Simplified to only chunk node_modules while keeping app code as single bundle
- **Impact**: Medium - Prevents module resolution errors

### 4. **React StrictMode** (Medium)
- **Problem**: React StrictMode can cause double rendering in Electron, leading to blank screens
- **Fix**: Disabled StrictMode for Electron builds in `index.tsx`
- **Impact**: Medium - Prevents rendering conflicts

### 5. **Window Visibility** (High)
- **Problem**: Window might not show if `ready-to-show` event doesn't fire
- **Fix**: Added multiple fallback checks:
  - Show window on `ready-to-show` event
  - Check and show on `dom-ready` event
  - Double-check and show on `did-finish-load` event
  - Timeout fallback after 3 seconds to force show
- **Impact**: High - Ensures window is always visible

### 6. **Renderer Process Recovery** (High)
- **Problem**: If renderer crashed, app would stay blank
- **Fix**: Added handlers for:
  - `render-process-gone` - Auto-reload on crash
  - `unresponsive` - Log unresponsive state
  - `responsive` - Log recovery
- **Impact**: High - Auto-recovery from crashes

### 7. **Background Throttling** (Low)
- **Problem**: Electron throttles background windows which can cause rendering issues
- **Fix**: Added command line switches to disable:
  - `--disable-background-timer-throttling`
  - `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`
  - `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`
- **Impact**: Low - Prevents background rendering issues

## üìÅ Files Modified
1. `index-electron.html` - Removed external font import
2. `electron/main.ts` - Updated webPreferences, added visibility checks and recovery handlers
3. `vite.config.ts` - Simplified build chunking
4. `index.tsx` - Disabled StrictMode for Electron
5. `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented changes (v1.19.8)

## üî® Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild the Application
```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Build the application
npm run build

# Build Windows executable
npm run electron:build:win
```

### 2. Test the Build
Run the Windows executable and verify:
- ‚úÖ Window appears immediately
- ‚úÖ GUI remains visible
- ‚úÖ No blank screen after a few seconds
- ‚úÖ Application functions normally
- ‚úÖ Network mode works
- ‚úÖ All features accessible

### 3. If Still Experiencing Issues
Check the debug log file: `station-v-debug.log`

Common issues and solutions:
- **Blank screen persists**: Check log for module loading errors
- **Slow startup**: Normal, cache will improve performance
- **Network mode issues**: Verify server starts correctly in log

## üîç How to Debug
If the blank screen still occurs:

1. Check `station-v-debug.log` for errors
2. Run with DevTools: The log will show when DevTools should open
3. Check for module loading errors in console
4. Verify all assets are in the `dist/` folder
5. Check that `dist-electron/` has the compiled files

## üìä Expected Improvements
- ‚ö° Faster window display - No external resource blocking
- üé® Consistent rendering - No StrictMode double rendering
- üîÑ Better recovery - Auto-reload on crashes
- üõ°Ô∏è More stability - Multiple visibility checks
- üìù Better logging - Comprehensive error tracking

## üöÄ Deployment
Once tested and verified working:
1. Update version in `package.json` to match CHANGELOG
2. Build the final distribution
3. Test on clean Windows machine
4. Create release notes
5. Distribute the fixed build

## üìù Notes
- Web client is unaffected by these changes
- All changes are Electron-specific
- No functionality changes to the application itself
- Only build and rendering improvements
