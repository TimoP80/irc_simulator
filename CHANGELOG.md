### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### **UI Going Blank After Sending Messages**
- **Fixed critical UI disappearing bug** - Fixed issue where UI would go completely blank after writing a message, affecting both channels and PMs
- **Root cause #1**: `activePM` could be `undefined` when the conversation wasn't created yet, causing `messagesInContext` to return an empty array
- **Root cause #2**: `addMessageToContext` was failing to create PM conversations for network users or when user wasn't found, causing the conversation to never be created
- **Solution #1**: Added fallback handling in `messagesInContext` to return empty array gracefully when `activePM` is undefined
- **Solution #2**: Enhanced `addMessageToContext` to:
  - Check both `virtualUsers` and `networkUsers` when looking for PM recipients
  - Use existing conversation's user if available
  - Create fallback user entry when user cannot be found, preventing UI from disappearing
  - Properly handle all user types (virtual, network, and unknown users)
- **Additional fix**: Added fallback user creation in `handlePMUserClick` when user is not found

#### **Improved User Experience**
- **Better error handling**: PM conversations now work even when users are not in the expected list
- **Prevented data loss**: Messages are now properly saved even if the user lookup fails
- **Graceful degradation**: UI remains stable even with invalid or missing user data

### üîß Bug Fixes

#### **Fixed TypeError in Relationship Memory Service**
- **Fixed date conversion errors** - Resolved "firstMet.getTime is not a function" error
- **Root cause**: Dates stored in relationship memory as strings were not being converted back to Date objects
- **Solution**: Added automatic date conversion in `calculateRelationshipLevel` and `initializeRelationshipMemory` functions
- **Impact**: Relationship memory now works correctly when loaded from storage, preventing UI from going blank

#### **Fixed Network Connection Timeout Issues**
- **Added connection timeout** - Network connection now times out after 10 seconds if server doesn't respond
- **Improved error messages** - More helpful error messages when connection fails
- **Better error handling** - Clear distinction between timeout, connection refused, and network errors
- **Enhanced debugging** - Better logging for connection status and close codes
- **Root cause**: Connection attempts would hang indefinitely when server wasn't running
- **Impact**: Users now get clear feedback when attempting to connect, making troubleshooting easier
