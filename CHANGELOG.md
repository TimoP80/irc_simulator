# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.0 - 2024-07-31

### Changed
- **Enhanced API Resilience**: Implemented an automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for all API calls. The application will now gracefully handle temporary API rate limit errors (`429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) by retrying the request a few times before failing, significantly reducing visible errors and improving the simulation's stability.
- **Smarter Error Feedback**: If the background simulation repeatedly fails even after retries, a single, non-spammy system message will now appear in the affected channel to inform the user. This prevents silent failures without flooding the chat with error messages.

## 1.1.0 - 2024-07-30

### Added
- **Simulation Speed Control**: Users can now adjust the speed of background AI chatter ('Fast', 'Normal', 'Slow') or turn it 'Off' completely via the Settings modal. This provides granular control over API usage.

### Changed
- **Improved API Quota Management**: The simulation now automatically pauses when the application's browser tab is not visible. This, combined with the speed controls, significantly reduces the likelihood of hitting per-minute API rate limits and helps conserve overall quota.
- **Default Simulation Speed**: The default 'Normal' simulation interval has been increased to 30 seconds to lower the default rate of API requests.

## 1.0.0 - 2024-07-29

### Initial Release

This is the first public release of the Gemini IRC Simulator, a fully AI-driven chat environment.

### Features

#### üöÄ Core Simulation
- **AI-Driven Environment**: Simulates a classic IRC experience where all channel activity and user interactions are generated by AI.

- **Private Messaging**: Initiate one-on-one private conversations with any of the AI virtual users.

#### üß† AI-Powered Interactions
- **Autonomous Channel Activity**: AI users generate continuous, in-character conversations in channels, creating a lively and believable atmosphere even when you're not typing.
- **Context-Aware Reactions**: AI users react realistically to your messages in both public channels and private messages, taking into account their defined personalities, the channel topic, and recent conversation history.
- **Distinct Personalities**: Each virtual user has a unique personality that guides their behavior, from a curious tech expert to a chaotic prankster.

#### üé® User Interface & Experience
- **Classic IRC Layout**: A familiar three-panel interface displaying channels/PMs, the main chat window, and the user list for the current context.
- **Seamless Context Switching**: Easily navigate between channels and private message conversations.
- **Visual Feedback**: An "AI is typing..." indicator provides feedback while waiting for a response.
- **Color-Coded Nicknames**: Unique colors are assigned to user nicknames in the chat window for improved readability.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Persistence
- **Onboarding Settings Modal**: First-time users are greeted with a settings modal to configure their experience from the start.
- **Persistent Configuration**: All your settings‚Äînickname, custom virtual users, and channels‚Äîare saved in your browser's local storage for a consistent experience across sessions.
- **Customizable Environment**:
