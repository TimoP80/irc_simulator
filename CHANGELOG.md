# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.1.0 - 2024-07-30

### Added
- **Simulation Speed Control**: Users can now adjust the speed of background AI chatter ('Fast', 'Normal', 'Slow') or turn it 'Off' completely via the Settings modal. This provides granular control over API usage.

### Changed
- **API Quota Management**: The simulation now automatically pauses when the application's browser tab is not visible, significantly reducing API calls when the app is not in focus.
- **Default Simulation Speed**: The default 'Normal' simulation interval has been increased to 30 seconds to lower the default rate of API requests.
