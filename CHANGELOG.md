  - Restructured SettingsModal to use button-based actions instead of form submission
  - Fixed z-index layering for proper modal stacking
  - Simplified event handling for better reliability

  - Channel name validation: Must start with #, 2-30 characters, proper format
  - Personality/Topic validation: Minimum length requirements and character limits
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Escape key support for all modals
- **Visual Status Badges**: "AI User" and "Channel" badges for better visual distinction

### Changed
- **Settings Modal Redesign**: Completely redesigned the settings modal with:
  - Larger modal size (max-w-4xl) to accommodate new interfaces
  - Scrollable content for better UX with many items
  - Modern card-based layout replacing text areas
  - Professional styling with hover effects and transitions

  - Intuitive add/edit/delete buttons with icons
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
  - Better visual hierarchy and spacing
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Technical Improvements
- **Component Architecture**: Created reusable modal and management components:
  - `AddUserModal` and `AddChannelModal` for form handling
  - `UserManagement` and `ChannelManagement` for list management
  - Proper separation of concerns and reusable patterns
- **Data Format Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility with existing text-based storage while providing modern UI
- **Form State Management**: Improved form handling with proper validation and error states

## 1.3.0 - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Cancel Button in Settings Modal**: Added a "Cancel" button to the configuration window, allowing users to view and explore AI world settings without applying changes. Users can now browse the settings and exit without committing to modifications.
- **Keyboard Shortcut Support**: Added Escape key support to close the settings modal, providing a more intuitive user experience.

### Changed
- **More Frequent Autonomous Messages**: Significantly increased the frequency of autonomous AI messages across all simulation speeds:
  - Fast: 15 seconds ‚Üí 5 seconds (3x more frequent)
  - Normal: 30 seconds ‚Üí 10 seconds (3x more frequent)  
  - Slow: 60 seconds ‚Üí 20 seconds (3x more frequent)
- **Enhanced Settings Modal UX**: Improved the settings modal with better button layout and consistent styling for the new cancel functionality.

## 1.2.0 - 2025-10-20

### Changed
- **Enhanced API Resilience**: Implemented an automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for all API calls. The application will now gracefully handle temporary API rate limit errors (`429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) by retrying the request a few times before failing, significantly reducing visible errors and improving the simulation's stability.
- **Smarter Error Feedback**: If the background simulation repeatedly fails even after retries, a single, non-spammy system message will now appear in the affected channel to inform the user. This prevents silent failures without flooding the chat with error messages.

## 1.1.0 - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Simulation Speed Control**: Users can now adjust the speed of background AI chatter ('Fast', 'Normal', 'Slow') or turn it 'Off' completely via the Settings modal. This provides granular control over API usage.

### Changed
- **Improved API Quota Management**: The simulation now automatically pauses when the application's browser tab is not visible. This, combined with the speed controls, significantly reduces the likelihood of hitting per-minute API rate limits and helps conserve overall quota.
- **Default Simulation Speed**: The default 'Normal' simulation interval has been increased to 30 seconds to lower the default rate of API requests.

## 1.0.0 - 2025-10-19

### Initial Release

This is the first public release of the Gemini IRC Simulator, a fully AI-driven chat environment.

### Features

#### üöÄ Core Simulation
- **AI-Driven Environment**: Simulates a classic IRC experience where all channel activity and user interactions are generated by AI.
- **Multiple Channels**: Join and participate in pre-configured or custom-defined channels, each with its own topic.
- **Private Messaging**: Initiate one-on-one private conversations with any of the AI virtual users.

#### üß† AI-Powered Interactions
- **Autonomous Channel Activity**: AI users generate continuous, in-character conversations in channels, creating a lively and believable atmosphere even when you're not typing.
- **Context-Aware Reactions**: AI users react realistically to your messages in both public channels and private messages, taking into account their defined personalities, the channel topic, and recent conversation history.
- **Distinct Personalities**: Each virtual user has a unique personality that guides their behavior, from a curious tech expert to a chaotic prankster.

#### üé® User Interface & Experience
- **Classic IRC Layout**: A familiar three-panel interface displaying channels/PMs, the main chat window, and the user list for the current context.
- **Seamless Context Switching**: Easily navigate between channels and private message conversations.
- **Visual Feedback**: An "AI is typing..." indicator provides feedback while waiting for a response.
- **Color-Coded Nicknames**: Unique colors are assigned to user nicknames in the chat window for improved readability.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Persistence
- **Onboarding Settings Modal**: First-time users are greeted with a settings modal to configure their experience from the start.
- **Persistent Configuration**: All your settings‚Äînickname, custom virtual users, and channels‚Äîare saved in your browser's local storage for a consistent experience across sessions.
- **Customizable Environment**:
  - Set your own **nickname**.
  - Define the entire cast of **virtual users** and their unique personalities.
  - Create your own **channels** with custom names and topics.

#### ‚ú® IRC Command Support
- **`/nick <new_name>`**: Change your display nickname on the fly.
- **`/join <#channel>`**: Switch to an existing channel.
