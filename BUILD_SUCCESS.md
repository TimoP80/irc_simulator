# 🎉 Windows Executable Build - SUCCESS!

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The Windows executable is now successfully created in the `release/` folder as requested!

## 📁 **Executable Location**

```
release/
└── win-unpacked/
    └── Station V - Virtual IRC Simulator.exe  ← Your executable!
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Build the Executable**

npm run electron:build:win
```

### **Run the Executable**
1. Navigate to `release/win-unpacked/`
2. Double-click `Station V - Virtual IRC Simulator.exe`
3. The application will start with the IRC server running automatically

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

1. **Output Directory**: Changed from `dist-electron` to `release`
