# Gemini IRC Simulator

### An Experiment in AI-Simulated Social Environments

---

## 1. The Core Idea: What is This Project?

The Gemini IRC Simulator is a web application that recreates the look and feel of a classic Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client with one fundamental difference: **you are the only human.**

Every other user in every channel, every message typed, and every interaction is generated in real-time by Google's Gemini AI. The project serves as a self-contained digital terrariumâ€”a sandbox for observing how well a large language model can simulate a dynamic, multi-participant social environment.

The central question we aim to explore is: **Can AI create a believable, engaging, and coherent social space that feels alive?**

## 2. The Experiment: Testing the Boundaries of AI Simulation

This project is more than just a tech demo; it's an interactive experiment designed to test several aspects of AI-driven simulation:

-   **Coherence & Consistency**: Can the AI agents maintain consistent personalities over time? Do they remember the context of the conversation, or do they easily get derailed?
-   **Believability**: Does the simulated chat room feel like a real (if slightly quirky) online community? Are the conversations natural, or do they feel sterile and robotic?
-   **Emergent Dynamics**: Can interesting social dynamics emerge from the interactions between AI agents? Will friendships, rivalries, or inside jokes develop organically?
-   **Engagement**: Is the environment compelling enough to hold a human user's attention? Can you have a meaningful or entertaining conversation with a bot that is also actively talking to other bots?

By interacting with the simulation, you are actively participating in this experiment and helping to answer these questions.

## 3. How It Works

The simulation is powered by the Gemini API, using carefully crafted prompts to guide the AI's behavior.

1.  **System Instruction**: A base instruction sets the scene, telling the AI its role is to simulate an IRC environment, adhere to strict formatting (`nickname: message`), and keep responses brief and in-character.
2.  **Autonomous Channel Activity**: At regular intervals, the application picks a random channel and prompts the AI to generate a message from one of the virtual users. This prompt includes the channel topic, a list of users with their personalities, and the recent message history. This creates the ambient "background chatter" that makes the world feel lived-in.
3.  **Reactive Responses**: When you send a message, a different prompt is sent to the AI. It includes the context of your message and asks the AI to generate a direct, in-character reaction from one of the other users in the channel.
4.  **Private Messaging**: When you open a private message with a virtual user, the prompts are tailored for a one-on-one conversation, focusing heavily on that user's specific personality and the private chat history.

## 4. Key Features

-   **Fully AI-Driven World**: Every user besides you is an AI agent powered by Gemini, each with a unique, customizable personality.
-   **Persistent & Customizable Environment**: The entire simulation is yours to control. Through the settings modal, you can define:
    -   Your own nickname.
    -   The complete cast of virtual users and their personalities.
    -   A custom list of channels and their topics.
    -   All settings are saved in your browser's local storage.
-   **Classic IRC Experience**: The app features a familiar three-panel UI (channels, chat, user list), a retro monospace aesthetic, and support for essential commands like `/nick`, `/join`, and `/who`.
-   **Dynamic Conversations**: The simulation feels alive with both ambient background chatter generated by the AI users and direct, context-aware responses to your messages.
-   **Private Messaging**: Peel off from the main channels to have focused, one-on-one conversations with any AI personality.

## 5. Getting Started

1.  The application runs entirely in your browser. No installation is needed.
2.  Upon first launch, you will be greeted by a **Settings** modal.
3.  **Configure your world**: Set your nickname and feel free to customize the default virtual users and channels. The format is simple: `name, description` on each line.
4.  Click **"Save and Start"** to enter the simulation. Your configuration will be saved for your next visit.
5.  **Note**: This application requires a valid Google Gemini API key to be present in the execution environment (`process.env.API_KEY`).

## 6. Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API via the `@google/genai` npm package.
